Sample Post-Loss Report Letter to Insureds
    

Following is language for a suggested letter for agents to send to an insured after receipt of a catastrophe loss report. It should be prepared on the agency's letterhead.



Dear (Customer):

The report of damage to your property caused by the hurricane is acknowledged. We have forwarded the necessary written report to (name of adjusting organization, address and phone number) and a representative will contact you as soon as possible.

You should arrange for temporary repairs needed to protect your property from further damage. The bill for any such necessary repairs should be held by you pending arrival of the adjuster and the cost will be included in your claim. Contractorsâ€™ estimates for permanent repairs may not be necessary unless there is extensive damage, since the adjuster can make estimates using prevailing cost figures of local contractors and repair shops. It is, of course, your privilege to obtain detailed estimates from a contractor of your choice before settling the loss. We feel, however, that the adjuster is capable of arriving at a fair settlement and also think this procedure will expedite loss settlements. If you do secure estimates, please hold them for the adjuster.

In a catastrophe such as this, the facilities of all insurance companies are taxed to an unusual degree because of the thousands of losses that have suddenly occurred. The companies this agency represents have augmented their local facilities by bringing in adjusters from other parts of the country to expedite loss adjustment work. Your loss will receive attention as soon as possible.

Your understanding and cooperation in this trying situation is greatly appreciated. Do not hesitate to get in touch with us about any questions concerning your loss.

Sincerely,

(Agent signature)
